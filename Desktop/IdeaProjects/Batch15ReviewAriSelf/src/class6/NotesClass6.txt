Logical Operators:
  Logical operators allow us to combine multiple conditions.
  only work with boolean(true, false) we can use
  There are Three logical operators
  1) !, ||, &&
  Why we should use Logical Operators
    1) They can greatly simplify the logic
    2) it helps us reduce the lines of code that we have to write
    NOT(!):
         it reverse the conditions. if something is true it will make it false and if something false it
         will make it true
         System.out.println(!true) =>false

     Logical Or Operators(||):

     it combine two or more conditions and returns true as long as there is one condition is true if all the conditions
     became false it returns us a false
