   Just another set of symbol that we can use to combine multiple boolean values.
   There are three logical operators ! || &&

   Why we should learn about the logical operators?
     We can greatly simplify th
     s logical if we use the these operators

     What is the Syntax?
      they only work with the boolean data type
      if(!condition)
      if(condition1 || condition2)
      if( condition1 &&  condition2)


NOT Operators(!)

      if something false it will make it true.



What is a SwitchCase statement?
   Switch case statement are just another of achieving the same result as if -else if condition

 Why should we learn about them
    The reason we should use them is they are  very fast

    Striing(var)
    switch(var){
    case 1:
    sout"1"
    break;

    } that

    Rules that we should follow:
    we can only use byte short int char String in switch case statement
    we cant use relational operation in  switch case statement
